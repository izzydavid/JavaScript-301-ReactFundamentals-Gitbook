# Movie Search App

The next app we're going to build is a movie search app using [this](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API. 

### What We're Going to Build & Learn
- First, we'll build an input that allows users to search for movies in a database. We'll also display results based on what they type. 
- We're going to learn how to use `styled-components` inside each of our React files, to easily style things.
- The second part of the app we'll build is a section showing new movies at the box office. Here we'll learn more about utilizing APIs in react.

### Folder Structure

To start off our application, let's go ahead and make a folder for this application called `movie-search-app` inside of our `apps` folder. We'll also add 3 files to help you out. 

```
    └── src
        └── assets
        └── components
                └── apps
                    └── movie-search-app
                        └── Form.js
                        └── FormResults.js
                        └── MovieApp.js
                        
```

### Routes
Next, we need to configure out links/routes , so first inside of `Sidebar.js` insert the following link:

```js
<li><Link to="/movie">Movie Search App</Link></li>
```

In `_routes.js` add the following route.

```js
 {
      path: '/movie',
      exact: true,
      main: () => <MovieSearchApp />
    }, 
```
You'll also need to set up the import for the `MovieSearchApp` component:

```js
import MovieSearchApp from '../apps/movie-search-app/MovieApp';
```


### MovieApp.js
Now that we've set up our routing so that our app can find our new Movie App, let's go ahead and add our parent component file. Inside of `movie-search-app` create your first file called `MovieApp.js`. 

Let's go ahead and set up our parent component. Type the following code below into your `MovieApp`.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Form } from './Form';

export default class MovieApp extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="main">
                <div className="mainDiv">
                    <Form />
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

Next, we'll start on our Form component!
